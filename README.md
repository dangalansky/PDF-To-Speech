# PDF-To-Voice
Easily convert PDF documents to speech mp3s using google text-to-speech.

Say It! requires the importation of PyPDF2, gtts (google text-to-speech), tkinter, PIL, and pygame. 

Simply choose a .pdf to upload and convert to text using PyPDF2. This file will be saved into the working directory as "pdf.txt".

Type in the name you'd like to save your MP3 file as.

Clicking on "Save as MP3" uses google text-to-speech to translate the text to a voiced version which saves the MP3 into your working directory. This may take a while depending on the length of the document. 

This GUI also contains a "Play" button but it is unlikely you will also want to play from within the program. 

GUI design done by yours truly. Feel free to steal or destroy at will. <br>
